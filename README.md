# ATmega32-Isolated-Relay-Control-PCB
This repository contains the complete hardware and firmware design for a custom PCB that uses an ATmega32 microcontroller to control two opto-isolated 24V relays. The board is powered by a URB2405YMD-10WR3 DC-DC converter module (isolated, 5V, 10W) and is programmable via an FTDI USB-to-Serial adapter.
